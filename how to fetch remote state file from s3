When you configure Terraform to use an S3 bucket as a remote state backend, Terraform will automatically handle fetching the remote state data from the S3 bucket when you run Terraform commands like terraform plan or terraform apply.

Here is a high-level overview of how Terraform fetches the remote state data from S3:

When you run a Terraform command that requires the remote state data, Terraform sends a request to the S3 API to fetch the state file.

The S3 API retrieves the state file from the S3 bucket and sends it back to Terraform.

Terraform receives the state file and uses it to compare the current state of the infrastructure with the desired state defined in your Terraform code.

After generating a plan, Terraform may also write changes to the state file and upload it back to the S3 bucket as part of the terraform apply process.

Note that Terraform will automatically manage versioning of the state file in the S3 bucket, so you can always go back to previous versions of the state if needed.
